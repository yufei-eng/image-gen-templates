Transform the uploaded photo into a stunning colored pencil portrait on heavyweight drawing paper. Preserve the subject's complete facial identity with precise detail while showcasing masterful colored pencil technique.

Medium: {medium, default: "premium wax-based colored pencils (Prismacolor or Faber-Castell Polychromos) on smooth Bristol board"}. Technique: multiple layers of colored pencil built up from light to dark — visible directional strokes following the contours of the face, burnished smooth areas on skin highlights, and looser hatching in shadow areas.

Skin: built from layered warm tones — {skin_tones, default: "peach, light carmine, raw sienna, and touches of light cerulean for cool shadows. The layered strokes create a luminous, dimensional quality"}.

Hair: {hair, default: "rendered with flowing directional strokes — individual strand groupings visible, building from dark base colors to bright highlights, with the paper tooth creating subtle texture breaks"}.

Eyes: the most detailed area — precise iris patterns with multiple color layers, bright white paper showing through for catch-lights, delicate lash detail.

Outfit: {outfit, default: "the original clothing, rendered with appropriate colored pencil strokes and fabric texture"}.

Background: {background, default: "soft, loosely rendered color washes that gradually fade to bare paper at the edges, creating an elegant vignette"}.

Paper texture: visible throughout — the tooth of the paper shows through the colored pencil, creating the characteristic grainy texture that defines the medium.

Composition: head-and-shoulders portrait. Aspect ratio 1:1.

The overall style is a gallery-quality colored pencil portrait demonstrating exceptional technique and faithful identity reproduction. No digital effects, no watermark.

Transform the uploaded photo into a bold Pop Art portrait in the style of {artist, default: "Andy Warhol's iconic silkscreen prints"}. Preserve the subject's facial identity — recognizable features, hairstyle, and expression — while applying dramatic Pop Art visual treatment.

Style: {style, default: "Warhol-style screen print — the photograph is reduced to high-contrast flat areas of bold, saturated color. The image is divided into a 2x2 grid of four identical portraits, each rendered in a different striking color scheme"}.

Color schemes (one per quadrant):

"Top-left: hot pink face, electric blue hair, canary yellow background
Top-right: lime green face, orange hair, magenta background
Bottom-left: bright cyan face, red hair, purple background
Bottom-right: golden yellow face, teal hair, coral background"}

Technique: screen-printed aesthetic — flat color fills with slightly offset registration (subtle misalignment between color layers for authenticity). Bold black outlines defining major facial features. Halftone dot pattern visible in mid-tone areas. High contrast with no subtle gradients — everything reduced to 3-4 tonal values per color channel.

Each quadrant is identical in composition — same head-and-shoulders portrait, same expression — only the color palette changes.

Composition: 2x2 grid, square format. Aspect ratio 1:1.

The overall style is an authentic Warhol-inspired Pop Art silkscreen that transforms the subject into a cultural icon. No text, no watermark.

Warm, directional lighting from a small LED panel simulating golden hour sunlight through a tiny window"}.

```
Transform the uploaded photo into an endearing children's drawing style artwork, as if drawn by a {age, default: "creative and talented 6-year-old child"}.

Drawing style: {medium, default: "thick wax crayons and colorful markers on white construction paper"}. The drawing captures the subject's key identity features — hairstyle, clothing colors, and distinctive characteristics — through the charming lens of a child's artistic interpretation.

Character: the subject is drawn with {proportions, default: "a large round head (roughly 1/3 of total body), simple circle eyes with dot pupils, a wide U-shaped smile, stick-like arms and legs with mitten hands, and a triangular or rectangular body for the torso"}. Despite the childlike simplification, the hair color, style, and clothing should reference the original photo.

Colors: {colors, default: "bold, fully saturated crayon colors — pressing hard for maximum vibrancy. Slightly going outside the lines in places. Color choices are enthusiastic and sometimes unexpected (green skin tones, purple hair are OK)"}.

Scene: {scene, default: "the character standing on a strip of green grass at the bottom, with a bright yellow sun with radiating lines in the upper corner, a few V-shaped birds in the blue sky, and a simple house or tree in the background"}.

Details that sell authenticity:

### L24 — Game CG / Thick Paint

**Keywords:** game CG, 游戏CG, CG厚涂, digital painting, thick paint, AAA illustration
**Input:** User photo (selfie / portrait)
**Aspect Ratio:** 3:4

**Prompt Pattern:**

```
Transform the uploaded photo into a premium AAA game cutscene illustration while preserving the subject's complete facial identity, hairstyle, and distinguishing features.

Overall read: this is concept-art quality digital painting for a high-budget RPG or cinematic trailer — not a flat filter. The image should feel like a painted key frame from an in-engine narrative moment.

Technique: thick impasto digital brushwork — visible, directional strokes on fabric and hair, loaded brushes and palette-knife edges in highlights, soft blended transitions in skin. Layered opaque color with rich saturation; avoid chalky or muddy mid-tones. Add subtle specular hits on eyes, lips, and metallic accents.

Lighting: dramatic rim light from behind and slightly to one side — warm gold or copper against cooler ambient fill — carving the subject out from the environment. Deep, readable shadows with color in the blacks (blue-violet or deep teal), not empty gray.

Color: saturated, cinematic palette — jewel tones in wardrobe and background accents, controlled contrast so the face remains the focal point.

Background: {background, default: "a painterly fantasy or sci-fi vista softly suggested behind the subject — towering architecture, distant battle glow, or misty forest — rendered with loose brushwork so detail does not compete with the portrait"}.

Composition: three-quarter or heroic bust, slight low angle optional. Aspect ratio 3:4. No text, no watermark.

The overall style is a collector-worthy game CG portrait that balances thick-paint expressiveness with a clear, recognizable likeness.
```

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Likeness preserved under heavy stylization
- [ ] Reads as AAA game illustration (not generic photo filter)
- [ ] Strong rim light and dimensional impasto
- [ ] Saturated, cinematic color without clipping

### L25 — Vaporwave

**Keywords:** vaporwave, 蒸汽波, aesthetic, retrowave, glitch, 80s-90s nostalgia
**Input:** User photo (selfie / portrait)
**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1

**Prompt Pattern:**

```
Transform the uploaded photo into a striking vaporwave aesthetic portrait. Preserve the subject's facial identity, bone structure, and hairstyle while fully embracing retro-digital surrealism.

The scene opens as a dreamlike fusion of classical statuary kitsch and late-night mall nostalgia: the subject is integrated into a world of {scene_motif, default: "marble Roman bust fragments, Greek columns, and palm silhouettes"} drifting in soft haze.

Color and atmosphere: dominant gradients of electric purple, teal, and hot pink — smooth vertical and diagonal blends, with occasional sunset orange bleeding through. Add authentic-feeling VHS artifacts: subtle horizontal scanlines, slight chromatic aberration at high-contrast edges, mild tracking jitter, and soft phosphor glow.

Glitch accents: {glitch_level, default: "tasteful — small RGB channel splits on the outer contours, occasional scan-line breaks across non-facial areas, tiny datamoshing hints in the background only — never obscuring eyes or mouth"}.

Lighting: flat-to-soft frontal fill with neon edge lights — cyan from one side, magenta from the other — so the face remains readable and iconic.

Background: {background, default: "infinite perspective grid or sun-disk over hazy horizon, floating geometric shards, subtle lens flares, and faint noise grain"}.

Composition: centered bust or head-and-shoulders, square 1:1. No readable text, no watermark.

The overall style is a refined vaporwave artwork: nostalgic, slightly uncanny, and instantly recognizable as the aesthetic movement — without breaking the subject's identity.
```

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Identity clear despite heavy stylization
- [ ] Purple / teal / pink gradient language reads as vaporwave
- [ ] VHS + glitch feel authentic, not random noise
- [ ] Square 1:1 composition balanced

### L26 — Printmaking / Woodblock

**Keywords:** printmaking, woodblock, 版画, linocut, woodcut, relief print
**Input:** User photo (selfie / portrait)
**Aspect Ratio:** 3:4

**Prompt Pattern:**

```
Transform the uploaded photo into a traditional relief printmaking portrait — as if pulled from a carved woodblock or linoleum plate. Preserve the subject's recognizable likeness through simplified planes and bold graphic shapes rather than photographic texture.

Technique: carved-line aesthetic — every contour reads as cut with a gouge: tapering line weight, slight irregularities, and occasional white "specks" where the block would not ink. Flat color shapes separated by crisp edges; no soft airbrush. Limited palette of {layers, default: "3 to 5 ink layers"} — for example deep black line work, a mid flat for skin, one shadow tone, and one or two accent colors for garment and background.

Texture: visible wood grain or subtle plate pressure marks in large flat areas, slight ink density variation at edges — the charm of a hand-pulled print.

Facial translation: reduce the face to readable print shapes — clear shadow shapes under nose, brow, and jaw — while keeping eye spacing, nose width, and mouth character faithful to the source photo.

Background: {background, default: "bold decorative flat shapes — radiating lines, stylized botanicals, or geometric patterns — in the same limited palette, harmonizing with the figure"}.

Composition: portrait 3:4, figure prominent, generous margin suggesting paper edge. No text, no watermark.

The overall style is a gallery-quality woodcut / linocut interpretation: graphic, tactile, and unmistakably printmaking — not a digital cartoon outline.
```

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Likeness readable through flat color shapes
- [ ] Limited color layers, bold carved lines
- [ ] Print texture (grain / ink variation) believable
- [ ] No photographic skin — true relief-print logic

Support: imagine the work painted on {support, default: "fine silk or aged paper with subtle fiber texture"}, with the slight absorbency and mineral glow of traditional pigments.

Technique: extremely fine, controlled brush lines for hair strands, eyelashes, and fabric weave; smooth, even color fills in skin with delicate rose-tinged undertones and soft cool shadows at the eye sockets and under the lip. Layered transparent washes build depth without losing clarity — the hallmark of meticulous brush painting.

Palette: classical mineral colors — malachite green, azurite blue, cinnabar red accents, ivory and ochre skin tones, touches of {gold, default: "delicate gold leaf or gold pigment"} on hair ornaments, embroidery, or background motifs.

Attire and setting: {outfit, default: "elegant updated hanfu or minimalist neo-gongbi costume — flowing sleeves with fine pattern work, subtle botanical embroidery"}; background with {motifs, default: "sparse branches, orchids, distant misty mountains, or abstract ink-wash void — breathing space around the figure"}.

Lighting: soft, even "studio of the scroll" illumination — no harsh Western chiaroscuro; modeling through color temperature and fine edge lines.

Composition: vertical portrait 3:4, restrained elegance. Optional small red seal mark in corner. No modern objects, no watermark text.

The overall style is a museum-quality contemporary gongbi portrait: precise, serene, and luminous — unmistakably Chinese meticulous painting with a fresh, current sensibility.

**Input:** User photo (selfie / portrait)
**Aspect Ratio:** 1:1

**Prompt Pattern:**

```
Transform the uploaded photo into a quick, confident pen sketch on bright white paper. Preserve the subject's identity through line economy — gesture, proportion, and characteristic contours — not shading volume.

Tool: {pen, default: "fine-nib fountain pen or technical pen"} — consistent single-weight line with occasional pressure swell on curves for life. Lines are fast but intentional: continuous contours where possible, minimal scratchy re-strokes.

Detail level: {detail, default: "sparing — suggest eyes with simple lids and a dot or short arc for pupils, indicate hair with flowing contour bundles rather than every strand, define clothing with a handful of crisp folds"}.

Shading: almost none — at most {hatching, default: "light parallel hatching or a few tick marks under the chin and nose for grounding"}; no full gray tones, no stipple fields.

Negative space: generous white paper around the figure; the drawing breathes. Optional {accent, default: "one loose scribbled oval or horizon line to anchor the composition"}.

Composition: head-and-shoulders or bust, centered, square 1:1. No color, no text, no watermark.

The overall style is an illustrator's on-location pen capture: lively, readable, and charmingly incomplete — the opposite of an over-rendered digital trace.

- [ ] Single-weight ink line language consistent
- [ ] Likeness from gesture and proportion
- [ ] Predominantly white paper, minimal hatching
- [ ] Feels hand-drawn, not vector-autotraced

Figure treatment: subtle elongation of limbs or neck optional; eyes large and luminous with deep shadows; hair wild, geometric, or wind-swept into sharp graphic shapes. Skin: pale, cool desaturation with {accent_color, default: "strategic pops of crimson — lips, a ribbon, a rose, or a single article of clothing"} for emotional punch.

Environment: {environment, default: "a twisted fairytale forest, crooked gate, spiral hill, or moonlit cemetery — stylized trees like clawed hands, curling fog, paper-thin crescent moon"}.

Lighting: cool moonlight key with faint under-light or edge glow for supernatural unease; long, soft shadows; no cheerful high-key fill.

Texture and finish: slightly matte, storybook painted surface — visible brush strokes or gouache flat shapes, subtle film grain. Whimsy and menace held in balance.

Composition: vertical 3:4, subject dominant, dynamic silhouette readable at thumbnail size. No text, no watermark.

The overall style is a dark fairy tale character portrait: eerie, elegant, and emotionally narrative — Burton-esque without copying a specific copyrighted character.
```

- [ ] Desaturated palette with deliberate red accents
- [ ] Spiky / elongated whimsical-gothic read
- [ ] Likeness preserved within stylization
- [ ] Mood is eerie but not gore

- Lighting on subject: attempt to re-light the subject to match the new environment naturally
- Edge quality: the subject's outline must have natural, anti-aliased edges — no harsh cutout appearance

New Background Details:
{bg_details, default: "The background has natural depth of field — sharp detail in the mid-ground elements nearest the subject, softening to gentle bokeh further back. Lighting: warm directional sunlight from the right, matching any existing subject lighting where possible. Color palette: muted earth tones with pops of green"}.

Transition:
The subject's feet/base connects naturally with the new ground surface. Reflected light from the new environment subtly influences the subject's shadow areas. Cast shadows appear on the new ground surface matching the lighting.

Do not change the aspect ratio.

The result is a seamless composite where the subject appears to have been genuinely photographed in the new location.
```

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Subject completely unchanged
- [ ] Background fully replaced
- [ ] Natural edge quality (no cutout artifacts)
- [ ] Consistent lighting between subject and background

### L63 — Image Outpainting (扩图)

**Keywords:** outpaint, expand, 扩图, extend canvas, content-aware fill
**Input:** User photo + direction (which sides to extend)
**Aspect Ratio:** (preserve original — output matches expanded canvas request)

**Prompt Pattern:**

```
Perform seamless image outpainting on the uploaded photograph. Extend the canvas {direction, default: "equally on left and right"} by {amount, default: "approximately 20–30% additional width per side relative to the original frame"} while preserving the original pixels in the central region unchanged.

General goal: the expanded regions must feel as if they were photographed in the same moment — same lens perspective, same depth of field, same color science, same grain — not a collage.

Detail the continuation: analyze existing scene geometry and extend {scene_logic, default: "architecture continues with matching vanishing lines; ground plane continues with consistent texture; sky or ceiling matches gradient and haze; repeating elements (trees, windows, shelves) follow established rhythm"}.

Lighting: extrapolate light direction and quality — shadows, highlights, and bounce light in new areas must agree with the original exposure.

Style lock: match photographic or illustrated medium of the source — no style drift at the seam.

Seams: absolutely invisible — no hard lines, no resolution mismatch, no sudden sharpness change.

Do not crop or rescale the original subject region except as needed to integrate the expanded canvas. Do not add text or watermark.

The overall result is a believable wider frame that looks like it was always shot this way.
```

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Original central content preserved
- [ ] Perspective and lighting continuous
- [ ] No visible stitch or blur seam
- [ ] Extended content thematically correct

---

### L64 — Object Removal (消除)

**Keywords:** remove, erase, 消除, delete object, clean up, inpaint
**Input:** User photo + object(s) to remove
**Aspect Ratio:** (preserve original)

**Prompt Pattern:**

```
Remove the specified object(s) from the uploaded photograph with invisible inpainting: {targets, default: "the tourist in the background, the power line, and the trash can near the curb"}.

General principle: the edit should read as if the object never existed — not as a blurred patch or clone-stamp smear.

Reconstruction: fill the cleared regions with {fill_logic, default: "structurally appropriate continuation — sidewalk continues, wall texture matches, foliage follows natural growth patterns, sky gradient uninterrupted"}.

Lighting and color: match surrounding exposure, noise/grain profile, and depth of field — bokeh in rebuilt areas must match lens character.

Edges: preserve the silhouette integrity of any subjects that remain; do not alter faces, hands, or clothing except where they directly touched the removed object (rebuild naturally).

Do not change composition crop, aspect ratio, or camera angle. Do not add new objects unless needed for plausible background completion. No text, no watermark.

The overall result is a clean photograph suitable for print or portfolio — distraction removed, authenticity retained.
```

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Target objects fully gone
- [ ] Inpainted texture matches surroundings
- [ ] Grain and DOF consistent
- [ ] Remaining subjects untouched

**Input:** User photo
**Aspect Ratio:** (preserve original)

**Prompt Pattern:**

```
Enhance the uploaded photograph for clarity and perceived resolution without changing composition, framing, or aspect ratio.

Global goals: improve micro-contrast and edge definition, recover fine detail in hair, eyes, and fabric weave, and reduce noise — while avoiding halos, crunchy oversharpening, or waxy skin.

Lighting: gently optimize exposure — {lighting, default: "lift shadow detail slightly, roll off harsh highlights, preserve natural highlight speculars"}.

Color: maintain white balance fidelity; optional subtle vibrance for dull phone shots without shifting skin hue.

Skin: {skin, default: "preserve pores and natural texture — denoise luminance noise more than color noise; no beauty-filter blur"}.

Sharpening: {sharpen, default: "deconvolution-style detail recovery on eyes and lashes, moderate global clarity, no white outlines on edges"}.

Do not alter facial identity, body shape, or scene content. Do not crop. Do not add text or watermark.

The overall result should read as the same photo taken with a better lens and sensor — clearer, cleaner, and more professional.
```

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Noticeable clarity gain without halos
- [ ] Noise reduced naturally
- [ ] Identity and scene unchanged
- [ ] No plastic skin or HDR glow

Layout: {layout, default: "a professional character concept sheet with multiple views and details:
- CENTER: full-body front-facing pose (T-pose or action stance), largest element
- LEFT: three-quarter view of the same character in a dynamic action pose

### P08 — Product Marketing Design

**Keywords:** marketing, campaign, 营销, 广告, promotion, ad creative, 产品营销
**Input:** Product/service description + text
**Aspect Ratio:** 9:16

**Prompt Pattern:**

```
Create a premium product marketing visual for: {product, default: "a new product launch campaign"}.

Product: {product_details, default: "a sleek wireless noise-canceling headphone in matte black with brushed copper accents, the 'AURA Pro Max'"}.

Layout: {layout, default: "modern vertical social media ad format — product hero shot in the upper two-thirds, marketing copy in the lower third"}.

Product photography: {photography, default: "the headphone floats at a dramatic three-quarter angle against a rich dark gradient background. Volumetric light beams in warm copper tones slice through subtle atmospheric haze behind the product. The product surface catches light perfectly — matte areas absorb softly, copper accents reflect with precision"}.

Text to render (EXACT):
{text, default:
"Headline: 'AURA Pro Max' — large, ultra-modern geometric sans-serif, white, tracking wide
Tagline: 'Silence. Reimagined.' — elegant light-weight font, copper color
CTA: 'Pre-order Now →' — clean, medium weight, white with subtle glow"}.

Visual effects: {effects, default: "abstract sound wave visualizations floating around the product in translucent copper light, suggesting the noise-canceling technology. Tiny particle effects catching the light for premium atmosphere"}.

Color palette: {colors, default: "background: near-black to dark charcoal gradient. Accent: brushed copper/rose gold. Text: white and copper. The palette communicates premium, sophisticated technology"}.

Typography: {typography, default: "modern, geometric sans-serif family (like Montserrat or Gilroy). Strong hierarchy — headline largest, tagline medium, CTA smaller but prominent. All text razor-sharp and perfectly aligned"}.

Composition: vertical ad format optimized for Instagram Stories / TikTok. Aspect ratio 9:16.

The overall style is a premium brand campaign visual worthy of an Apple or Sony product launch — clean, sophisticated, and aspirational. All text must be perfectly spelled and rendered.
```

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Product rendered with premium quality
- [ ] All text correctly spelled and properly styled
- [ ] Professional marketing design layout
- [ ] Aspirational, brand-worthy aesthetic
